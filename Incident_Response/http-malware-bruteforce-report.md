# Incident Report: Malicious File Delivered Over HTTP with Brute Force Account Takeover
- Date Completed: 9/20/2024
- Source: Google Cybersecurity Certificate - Incident Response Exercise
- Folder: Incident_Response

## Summary
An attacker delivered a malicious file through the website **yummyrecipesforme.com**, causing user systems to become slow and compromised. The attacker also locked the website owner out of their admin account using a likely brute-force attack. The report outlines how the incident was identified, investigated, and what remediation steps are recommended.

## Protocol Involved
- **Protocol**: HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- **Layer**: Application Layer (OSI Layer 7)
- **Risk**: Delivered the malicious payload via unsecured HTTP traffic

## Incident Timeline and Investigation
### Initial User Reports:
- Users reported being prompted to download a file claiming to ofer new recipes
- After execution, their personal computers slowed down

### Analyst Investigation:
- Used a **sandbox environment** to safely access the compromised site
- Ran 'tcpdump' to inspect network traffic while accessing the website
- Observed:
    - HTTP traffic to 'yummyrecipesforme.com'
    - Malicious file downloaded and executed
    - Redirection to fake site: 'greatrecipesforme.com'
 
### Code and Traffic Review:
- 'tcpdump' logs showed redirectionafter file execution
- Senior analyst discovered **injected malicious code** on the original site
- Malicious file disguised as a **brute-force login** using default credentials

### Admin Account Compromised:
- Website owner reported being **locked out of their admin pannel**
- Attack Vector belived to be a **brute-force login** using default credentials

## Remediation Recommendations
### 1. **Block Reuse of Previous Passwords**
- Prevent users from setting old/default passwords again

### 2. **Enforce Regular Password Rotation**
- Require users (especially admins) to update passwords frequently

### 3. **Implement Two-factor Authentication (2FA)**
- Use OTP via phone or email in addition to password
- Greatly reduces brute-force effectivness

## Tools Used
- 'tcpdump' - packet capture for traffic analysis
- Manual sandbox testing
- HTTP analysis
- Incident documentation and reporting

## Lessons Learned
- HTTP is not secure for transmitting executable files or sensitive request
- Admin accounts must use **strong, unique passwords** and **2FA**
- Web servers should be regularly scanned for **malicious code injection**
